Backbone.Typeahead
==================

A Bootstrap inspired Typeahead for Backbone.js


### How It Differs

Changed behaviors include:
* Expects Backbone models
* Menu reappears on input focus if not item has been selected (TODO point to the test case)


Additions:
* The Typeahead will fire a 'select' event upon Model selection
* The Typeahead will fire an 'deselect' event when the input is changed or deleted
